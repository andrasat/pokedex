Pokedex React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup Project

Make sure you have NodeJS installed already in your workstation,<br>
if not then you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or use a [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

then inside the project folder first run this command

#### `npm install | yarn | yarn install`

then set up `.env` file with fields similar in `.env.example`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev | yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
